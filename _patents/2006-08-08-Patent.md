Abstract
========
A system and method provides protocol independent communication between mobile electronic devices.
Multiple users may communicate using different applications running on different mobile electronic devices with different end-to-end protocols.
A multimedia controller in connection with control agents provides the information to establish communications between mobile electronic devices having applications with incompatible communication protocols.
A session and routing controller controls communication sessions and a Web hyperlink dictionary provides information regarding the location of the multimedia controller and control agents.
