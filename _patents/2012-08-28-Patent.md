Abstract
========
A system and method for predictive abnormal behavior detection is disclosed. 
The system receives surveillance data such as video data and can create and update a plurality of prediction models. 
The system may also receive video data relating to a moving object and may generate a prediction of the future locations of the moving object based on the generated prediction models. 
The predicted motion may be scored by a scoring engine to determine if the predicted motion is unsafe or otherwise undesirable.
