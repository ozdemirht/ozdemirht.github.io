Abstract
========
A surveillance system generally includes a data capture module that collects sensor data. 
A scoring engine module receives the sensor data and computes at least one of an abnormality score and a normalcy score based on the sensor data, at least one dynamically loaded learned data model, and a learned scoring method. 
A decision making module receives the at least one of the abnormality score and the normalcy score and generates an alert message based on the at least one of the abnormality score and the normalcy score and a learned decision making method to produce progressive behavior and threat detection.
