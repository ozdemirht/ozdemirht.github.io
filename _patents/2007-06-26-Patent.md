Abstract
========
Distributed modules in a network dynamically select communication protocols to communicate in a secure or firewall-protected network. 
Applications register with a lookup service. 
The lookup service maintains a lookup table including registration information for multiple applications. 
Registration information may include, but is not limited to, IP address, firewall restrictions, tunnel protocol, port information, and proxy queue capabilities. 
An application seeking to communicate acquires the registration information for a desired recipient from the lookup table. 
The application uses the registration information to select communication protocols necessary to communicate with the recipient.
