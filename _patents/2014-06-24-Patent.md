Abstract
========
A method is provided for detecting a threat in a distributed multi-camera surveillance system. 
The method includes: 
monitoring movement of an object in a field of view of a first camera using software installed at the first camera; 
detecting a suspicious object at the first camera when movement of the object does not conform with a motion flow model residing at the first camera; 
sending a tracking request from the first camera to a second camera upon detecting the suspicious object at the first camera; 
monitoring movement of the object in a field of view of the second camera using software installed at the second camera; 
assigning threat scores at the second camera when the movement of the object does not conform with a motion flow model residing at the second camera; 
and generating an alarm based in part on the threat scores detected at the first camera and the second camera.
