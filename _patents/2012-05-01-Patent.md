Abstract
========
A multi-perspective context sensitive behavior assessment system includes an adaptive behavior model builder establishing a real-time reference model that captures intention of motion behavior. 
It operates by modeling outputs of multiple user defined scoring functions with respect to multiple references of application specific target areas of interest. 
The target areas have criticality values representing a user's preference regarding the target areas with respect to one another. 
The outputs of the scoring functions are multiplied by the critically values to form high level sequences of representation that are communicated to the user.
