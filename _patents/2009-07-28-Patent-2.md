Abstract
========
A meta data management system for use with a surveillance system includes a user interface that allows users to define rules to manage meta data from distributed devices. 
An application programming interface provides an application access to system data and control information. 
A mechanism allows the application to transparently and seamlessly integrate with different types of databases by transparently allocating and searching the data that are physically distributed at different devices.
