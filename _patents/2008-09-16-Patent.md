Abstract
========
A peer-to-peer camera sensor network is defined using intelligent cameras that employ iSCSI initiators and iSCSI targets to read and write data and to send control commands directly across the network as iSCSI blocks. 
Because data transfer rides on top of the internet protocol, cameras can be directly attached to the internet without requiring attachment to a host computer. 
Image data represented as video frames are mapped onto iSCSI data blocks and are shared among the cameras directly to form an efficient virtual block level video image frame storage that can be directly manipulated by multiple cameras without data replications. 
Transport of multiple streams, associated with scalable or multilevel MPEG encoding scheme for instance, are automatically sequenced and realigned as the iSCSI data blocks are time-aligned.
