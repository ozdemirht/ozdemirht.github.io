Abstract
========
An Intelligent, dynamic, long-term digital Surveillance Media storage System (ISMS), proposes an intelligent, dynamic, digital media storage mechanism for digital surveillance applications that can analyze media streams in real-time and provide flexible, scalable, and self-adjustable encoding and indexing mechanisms based on actual needs for digital surveillance systems. 
The system includes several subsystems, such as: 
(1) a media stream retriever/receiver; 
(2) a content-based description generator; 
(3) an intelligent engine with metadata description storage and media file storage 
(4) an event manager; 
(5) a media stream writer; and 
(6) an encoding optimizer.
