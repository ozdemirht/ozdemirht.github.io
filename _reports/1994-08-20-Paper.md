Abstract
-------- 
Karyotyping system processes chromosome images and classifies them. This system consists of the following steps:

 - processing images for enhancement: various local, histogram based, adaptive enhancement operators are implemented.
 - object extraction: includes edge detection and sometimes human guidance is required to be able to extract the objects from the scene correctly.
 - feature extraction: a set of features are obtained from the image of each object.
 - classification: assigning the chromosomes to the right classes.
