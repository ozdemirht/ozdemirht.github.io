Abstract
-------- 
n this paper, we describe an approach to high performance computing which makes extensive use of commodity technologies. 
In particular, we exploit new Web technolgies such as XML, CORBA and COM based distributed objects and Java.
The use of commodity hardware (workstation and PC based MPP's) and operating systems (UNIX, Linux and Windows NT) is relatively well established.
We propose extending this strategy to the programming and runtime environments supporting developers and users of both parallel computers and large scale distributed systems.
