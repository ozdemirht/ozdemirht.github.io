Abstract
-------- 

We review the growing power and capability of commodity computing and communication technologies largely driven by commercial
distributed information systems. These systems are built from CORBA, Microsoft’s COM, JavaBeans, and rapidly advancing Web
approaches. One can abstract these to a three-tier model with largely independent clients connected to a distributed network
of servers....
