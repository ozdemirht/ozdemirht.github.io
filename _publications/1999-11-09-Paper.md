Abstract
-------- 
Crew scheduling is an NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization problem, which is very important for the airline industry. We propose a genetic algorithm, GraGA, to solve this problem. A new graph based representation utilizes memory effectively, and provides a framework in which we can easily develop various genetic operators.
