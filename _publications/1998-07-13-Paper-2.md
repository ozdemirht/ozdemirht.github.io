Abstract
-------- 
We present here our Pragmatic Object Web based approach to High Performance Modeling and Simulation and we describe the associated middleware software recently prototyped at NPAC: JWORB (Java Web Object Request Broker) which integrates HTTP and IIOP protocols, and Object Web RTI which implements DMSO RTI 1.3 on top of the JWORB based CORBA / Java software bus. We explain how JWORB and OW RTI are used to build WebHLA – an interactive FMS training environment and we outline our plan towards WebHLA based Virtual Prototyping Environments for Testing, Evaluation and Simulation Based Acquisition.
