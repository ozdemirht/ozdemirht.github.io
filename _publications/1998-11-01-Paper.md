Abstract
-------- 
We present here an approach towards visual authoring environments for Web/Commodity based distributed object/componentware computing using the WebFlow system under development at NPAC as a case study. 
WebFlow is a 3-tier Java based visual dataï¬‚owsystem with applets based authoring, visualization and control front-ends, and with servlets based middleware management ofbackend modules that wrap legacy codes such as databases or high performance simulations.
