excerpt: 'This paper presents an approach to the next generation of televirtual (TVR) environments that integrate collaboration with distributed computing and modern modeling and simulation technologies. It follows a three-tier architecture with Web Object (Java/CORBA) based middleware, VRML/Java3D/DirectX based front-ends, and JDBC/PSS/OLEDB based back-ends. It also tests the design and integration concepts that it mentions by prototyping a multi-user authoring and runtime environment, in order to support WebHLA-based, distributed military simulations. The paper lists a taxonomy of collaboratory frameworks and presents an integration paradigm, based on the WebFlow system at the Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC).'

Abstract
-------- 
This paper presents an approach to the next generation of televirtual (TVR) environments that integrate collaboration with distributed computing and modern modeling and simulation technologies. It follows a three-tier architecture with Web Object (Java/CORBA) based middleware, VRML/Java3D/DirectX based front-ends, and JDBC/PSS/OLEDB based back-ends. It also tests the design and integration concepts that it mentions by prototyping a multi-user authoring and runtime environment, in order to support WebHLA-based, distributed military simulations. The paper lists a taxonomy of collaboratory frameworks and presents an integration paradigm, based on the WebFlow system at the Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC).
